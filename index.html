Based on more than 200 personal interviews with both current and former Scientologists - both famous and less well known - and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative ability to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology. </p> <p>At the book’s center, two men whom Wright brings vividly to life, showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, whose restless, expansive mind invented a new religion. And his successor, David Miscavige - tough and driven, with the unenviable task of preserving the church after the death of Hubbard. </p> <p>We learn about Scientology’s complicated cosmology and special language. We see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and how such stars are used to advance the church’s goals. And we meet the young idealists who have joined the Sea Org, the church’s clergy, signing up with a billion-year contract. </p> <p>In <i>Going Clear,</i> Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion, and whether Scientology is, in fact, deserving of this constitutional protection. Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observation, understanding, and shaping a story into a compelling narrative, Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that reveals the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is.</p>","releaseDate":"2013-01-17","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Americas","url":"18573526011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/003367/bk_rand_003367_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51Azz8JN4yL","asin":"B07GC92TM6","subHeading":"Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology","title":"Blown for Good","authors":"Marc Headley","narrators":"Marc Headley","length":"11 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51r7NPLJAJL","asin":"B07FXXWD6Z","title":"Journey into Darkness","authors":"John E.

For example, the matter that comprises all stars, planets, and living things turns out to be just a fraction of what actually exists. Moreover, we think that we control our actions, but data analytics can predict, with astonishing accuracy, when we will wake up, what we will buy, and even whom we will marry. </p> <p>The quest to pin down what's real and what's illusory is both philosophical and scientific, a metaphysical search for ultimate reality that goes back to the ancient Greeks. For the last 400 years, this search has been increasingly guided by scientists, who create theories and test them in order to define and redefine reality. And we have developed the power to alter our own reality in major ways - to defeat diseases, compensate for disabilities, and augment our intellect with computers. Where is that trend going? </p> <p>Experience the thrill of this exciting quest in 36 wide-ranging lectures that touch on many aspects of the ceaseless search for reality. From the birth of the universe to brain science, discover that separating the real from the illusory is an exhilarating intellectual adventure. </p> <p>Scientists and philosophers are not alone in grappling, at an intellectual level, with reality. Some of the most accessible interpretations are by painters, novelists, filmmakers, and other artists whose works not only draw on the latest discoveries but also sometimes inspire them. Explore examples such as <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, pointillism, cubism, surrealism, and reality TV. </p> <p>And since dealing with reality is an experience we all share, this course is designed for people of all backgrounds. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-06-26","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"18574641011"},{"name":"Philosophy","url":"18574651011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000410/bk_tcco_000410_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51yAzlXme8L","asin":"1629976687","title":"A New History of Life","authors":"Stuart Sutherland, The Great Courses","narrators":"Stuart Sutherland","length":"17 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51KUkGV89PL","asin":"B00DICD9BE","title":"The History of Ancient Egypt","authors":"Bob Brier, The Great Courses","narrators":"Bob Brier","length":"24 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"514wFebZ+4L","asin":"1629976709","title":"Mysteries of the Microscopic World","authors":"Bruce E.

That was a long time ago, of course - before the time she calls \"adoption day\", when she and a dozen other children found themselves being raised by a man they learned to call Father. </p> <p>Father could do strange things. He could call light from darkness. Sometimes he raised the dead. And when he was disobeyed, the consequences were terrible. In the years since Father took her in, Carolyn hasn't gotten out much. Instead she and her adopted siblings have been raised according to Father's ancient Pelapi customs. They've studied the books in his library and learned some of the secrets behind his equally ancient power. Sometimes they've wondered if their cruel tutor might secretly be God. Now Father is missing. And if God truly is dead, the only thing that matters is who will inherit his library - and with it power over all of creation. </p> <p>As Carolyn gathers the tools she needs for the battle to come, fierce competitors for this prize align against her. But can Carolyn win? She's sure of it. What she doesn't realize is that her victory may come at an unacceptable price - because in becoming a god, she's forgotten a great deal about being human. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-06-16","publishers":[{"name":"HighBridge, a division of Recorded Books"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/high/000962/bk_high_000962_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51UsMF4kAhL","asin":"0593148479","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"A Cosmology of Monsters","authors":"Shaun Hamill","narrators":"Sean Patrick Hopkins","length":"10 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51Vf55H1nqL","asin":"B00L97M6MI","title":"Weaveworld","authors":"Clive Barker","narrators":"Simon Vance","length":"21 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"61HEnXD5ZxL","asin":"B01E7WQEVK","title":"Children of Earth and Sky","authors":"Guy Gavriel Kay","narrators":"Simon Vance","length":"19 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51fn4KdTW8L","asin":"1478916605","title":"The Trouble with Peace","authors":"Joe Abercrombie","narrators":"Steven Pacey","length":"21 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"51gevFKAUtL","asin":"1774240327","subHeading":"The Wandering Inn, Book 1","title":"The Wandering Inn","authors":"pirateaba","narrators":"Andrea Parsneau","length":"43 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"41oowPdyY7L","asin":"0525640479","title":"Dracul","authors":"Dacre Stoker, J.D.

He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations - all with mercurial, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed.&nbsp;</p> <p>But as Dave Itzkoff shows in this revelatory biography, Williams’ comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt, which he drew upon in his comedy and in celebrated films like <i>Dead Poets Society</i>; <i>Good Morning, Vietnam</i>; <i>The Fisher King</i>; <i>Aladdin</i>; and <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i>, where he showcased his limitless gift for improvisation to bring to life a wide range of characters. And in <i>Good Will Hunting </i>he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Itzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression - topics he discussed openly while performing and during interviews - and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew. Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues as well as extensive archival research, <i>Robin</i> is a fresh and original look at a man whose work touched so many lives.</p>","releaseDate":"2018-05-15","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"18571910011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Performing Arts","url":"18571923011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/003325/bk_aren_003325_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51aKkDyc-qL","asin":"B004TSAC1G","subHeading":"The Autobiography","title":"Up Till Now","authors":"William Shatner, David Fisher","narrators":"William Shatner","length":"10 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"51shGGmoyFL","asin":"B00M9KAD88","subHeading":"My Life in and out of Aerosmith","title":"Rocks","authors":"Joe Perry, David Ritz","narrators":"Joe Perry","length":"14 hrs and 20 mins"},{"cover":"61n8rPOJMJL","asin":"B00NI4CYUY","subHeading":"In Search of a Hidden Resistance in Afghanistan","title":"The Underground Girls of Kabul","authors":"Jenny Nordberg","narrators":"Kirsten Potter","length":"10 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51bK5xKUjXL","asin":"B075QJZ75M","subHeading":"John Adams and Thomas Jefferson","title":"Friends Divided","authors":"Gordon S.

Professor Fletcher, Professor of English and Film at The Ohio State University, brings both a personal and scholarly perspective to this craft. As a screenwriter himself, he has experienced the ins and outs of the process first-hand. And as a key faculty member in Project Narrative, a think tank devoted to using cognitive science to study the effects of stories on the human mind, Professor Fletcher offers unique insight into storytelling from both a neuroscientific and a literary perspective. </p> <p>Despite what you may have been told, writing a great script is not about formulas and three-act structure. Great scripts - great stories - are those that create the desired emotional response in audiences, something that can only be achieved by knowing which methods are most effective and how they suit the story you want to tell. As you study the work of over a dozen great screenwriters and several television shows, each story you encounter will use different tools to achieve a variety of psychological and emotional responses. From the redemption arc of the Western <i>Unforgiven</i> to the romantic longing of <i>Annie Hall</i>, each story offers invaluable insights you can bring to your own writing - and viewing - experiences. </p> <p>There is no cookie-cutter formula for writing scripts and no checklist for what makes a film or television show great. What <b>Screenwriting 101</b> offers instead is an infinitely flexible storytelling tool that has worked for the greats - from Euripides to Shakespeare to Pixar - and a selection of resources to show you how to put it to use. How you decide to use these limitless creative possibilities is up to you. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-11-10","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"18571910011"},{"name":"Art","url":"18571913011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000481/bk_tcco_000481_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51VMIGd1TxL","asin":"B01G7CMLR4","subHeading":"The Art of Verbal Action for Page, Stage, and Screen","title":"Dialogue","authors":"Robert McKee","narrators":"Robert McKee","length":"11 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51mCLnDtvgL","asin":"B00SJIVE3W","title":"Building a Better Vocabulary","authors":"Kevin Flanigan, The Great Courses","narrators":"Kevin Flanigan","length":"18 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"51Lh-yAPHtL","asin":"B00JLJI8AK","title":"The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal","authors":"Seth Freeman, The Great Courses","narrators":"Seth Freeman","length":"12 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"61HdTOvbbVL","asin":"B00I87YSGO","subHeading":"How Anyone at Any Age Can Learn to Speak Any Language from Anywhere in the World","title":"Fluent in 3 Months","authors":"Benny Lewis","narrators":"Benny Lewis","length":"6 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51V+L78oM0L","asin":"B014EG6BXK","subHeading":"A Former CIA Officer Reveals Safety and Survival Techniques to Keep You and Your Family Protected","title":"Spy Secrets That Can Save Your Life","authors":"Jason Hanson","narrators":"Jason Hanson","length":"6 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"519lkXBIpOL","asin":"B00DIEGPTA","title":"The Art of Conflict Management: Achieving Solutions for Life, Work, and Beyond","authors":"Michael Dues, The Great Courses","narrators":"Michael Dues","length":"12 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51xwYL6h+JL","asin":"B00D9473WC","title":"Your Deceptive Mind: A Scientific Guide to Critical Thinking Skills","authors":"Steven Novella, The Great Courses","narrators":"Steven Novella","length":"12 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"51ZF+yIxYbL","asin":"B00IXWH5KA","title":"How the Stock Market Works","authors":"Ramon P.

Yet how did all this emerge from what was once an insignificant village in central Italy? </p> <p>In <i>SPQR</i>, world-renowned classicist Mary Beard narrates the unprecedented rise of a civilization that even 2,000 years later still shapes many of our most fundamental assumptions about power, citizenship, responsibility, political violence, empire, luxury, and beauty. From the foundational myth of Romulus and Remus to 212 CE, nearly a thousand years later, when the emperor Caracalla gave Roman citizenship to every free inhabitant of the empire, <i>SPQR</i> (the abbreviation of \"The Senate and People of Rome\") not just examines how we think of ancient Rome but challenges the comfortable historical perspectives that have existed for centuries by exploring how the Romans thought of themselves: how they challenged the idea of imperial rule, how they responded to terrorism and revolution, and how they invented a new idea of citizenship and nation. </p> <p>Opening the audiobook in 63 BCE with the famous clash between the populist aristocrat Catiline and Cicero, the renowned politician and orator, Beard animates this \"terrorist conspiracy\", which was aimed at the very heart of the republic, demonstrating how this singular event would presage the struggle between democracy and autocracy that would come to define much of Rome's subsequent history. Illustrating how a classical democracy yielded to a self-confident and self-critical empire, <i>SPQR</i> reintroduces us, though in a wholly different way, to famous and familiar characters. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-11-19","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Ancient History","url":"18573549011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/009110/bk_reco_009110_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61Q34ktwaZL","asin":"B0038U1116","subHeading":"From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade","title":"The History of the Medieval World","authors":"Susan Wise Bauer","narrators":"John Lee","length":"22 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"514bRHmeDnL","asin":"B00CYNMAIG","subHeading":"From the Earliest Accounts to the Fall of Rome","title":"The History of the Ancient World","authors":"Susan Wise Bauer","narrators":"John Lee","length":"26 hrs and 20 mins"},{"cover":"518TPZPyx6L","asin":"B00DC8CFZK","title":"Herodotus: The Father of History","authors":"Elizabeth Vandiver, The Great Courses","narrators":"Elizabeth Vandiver","length":"12 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51XX+sfvu0L","asin":"B00DJ6K6KG","title":"The Vikings","authors":"Kenneth W.

You can only move through it. There is a path through pain to wisdom, through suffering to strength, and through fear to courage if we have the virtue of resilience. </p> <p>In 2012, Eric Greitens unexpectedly heard from a former SEAL comrade, a brother-in-arms he hadn’t seen in a decade. Zach Walker had been one of the toughest of the tough. But ever since he returned home from war to his young family in a small logging town, he’d been struggling. Without a sense of purpose, plagued by PTSD, and masking his pain with heavy drinking, he needed help. Zach and Eric started writing and talking nearly every day, as Eric set down his thoughts on what it takes to build resilience in our lives. </p> <p>Eric s letters drawing on both his own experience and wisdom from ancient and modern thinkers are now gathered and edited into this timeless guidebook. Resilience explains how we can build purpose, confront pain, practice compassion, develop a vocation, find a mentor, create happiness, and much more. Eric s lessons are deep yet practical, and his advice leads to clear solutions. </p> <p>We all face pain, difficulty, and doubt. But we also have the tools to take control of our lives. Resilience is an inspiring meditation for the warrior in each of us. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-03-10","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Health & Wellness","url":"18573370011"},{"name":"Psychology & Mental Health","url":"18573475011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/001921/bk_aren_001921_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51GWYqIXTCL","asin":"B01CF5FI7W","subHeading":"Words of Wisdom from the Partnership Letters of the World's Greatest Investor","title":"Warren Buffett's Ground Rules","authors":"Jeremy C.

Since its publication in 2007, I’ve been inundated with questions about why that inner voice is always talking, why so much of what it says is negative and stressful, and most importantly, how you free yourself from it.</p> <p>In this course, we will put to rest any questions you have about that inner dialogue. Not just about quieting it down - but about how to steadily remove the root cause of its existence.</p> <p>One of the greatest lessons you will learn here is that trying to achieve happiness by \"getting what you want\" is actually limiting your happiness. You end up struggling with life instead of experiencing it. True happiness comes only when your inner energy is free to flow. That unhampered flow is, indeed, the goal of this course.</p> <p>We will see that the most effective personal growth technique is to use life to remove your inner blockages, not compensate for them.</p> <p>In this course, you’ll learn about your true relationship to the world unfolding around you and to the thoughts and emotions arising within you.&nbsp;But most importantly, you will come into touch with the real \"you\" - the indwelling consciousness that is witnessing it all.</p> <p>The intention of this course is to change your entire perspective of life. Every session will challenge you to go beyond yourself.</p> <p>With great love and respect,</p> <p>Michael A.

While helping repair the marooned time traveler's glider, Cager realizes it can return him to his past to correct a mistake that had haunted him his entire life. As payment for his help, the virtual creature living in the circuitry of the marooned glider, sends Cager back in time as his 10-year-old self, knowing everything he'd known at 80 and gives him access to advanced equations of space and time. </p> <p>But living life over knowing the future isn't as easy as Cager has anticipated. His every action alters the future he remembers until much of what he remembers never happened at all. And those changes work against him at every turn, preventing him correcting the most serious mistake of his life. Now he must use his advanced mathematical ability to build his own time machine to go back and try again. But he needs a fortune even to begin. </p> <p>Then he receives help from a strange young woman with no history.

With no mercy and seemingly no motive, the Manson Family followed their leader's every order - their crimes lit a flame of paranoia across the nation, spelling the end of the 60s. Manson became one of history's most infamous criminals, his name forever attached to an era when charlatans mixed with prodigies, free love was as possible as brainwashing, and utopia - or dystopia - was just an acid trip away.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, when journalist Tom O'Neill was reporting a magazine piece about the murders, he worried there was nothing new to say. Then he unearthed shocking evidence of a cover-up behind the \"official\" story, including police carelessness, legal misconduct, and potential surveillance by intelligence agents. When a tense interview with Vincent Bugliosi - prosecutor of the Manson Family, and author of <i>Helter Skelter</i> - turned a friendly source into a nemesis, O'Neill knew he was onto something. But every discovery brought more questions:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Who were Manson's real friends in Hollywood, and how far would they go to hide their ties?</li> <li>Why didn't law enforcement, including Manson's own parole officer, act on their many chances to stop him?</li> <li>And how did Manson-an illiterate ex-con-turn a group of peaceful hippies into remorseless killers?</li> </ul> <p>O'Neill's quest for the truth led him from reclusive celebrities to seasoned spies, from San Francisco's summer of love to the shadowy sites of the CIA's mind-control experiments, on a trail rife with shady cover-ups and suspicious coincidences. The product of two decades of reporting, hundreds of new interviews, and dozens of never-before-seen documents from the LAPD, the FBI, and the CIA, CHAOS mounts an argument that could be, according to Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Steven Kay, strong enough to overturn the verdicts on the Manson murders. This is a book that overturns our understanding of a pivotal time in American history.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>","releaseDate":"2019-06-25","publishers":[{"name":"Hachette Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"True Crime","url":"18572017011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/hach/005239/bk_hach_005239_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61A1PO4UQ4L","asin":"B00W21ZCKI","subHeading":"The Unholy Alliance Between the Vatican, the CIA, and the Mafia","title":"Operation Gladio","authors":"Paul L.

For centuries, royal families have feared the gut-roiling, vomit-inducing agony of a little something added to their food or wine by an enemy. To avoid poison, they depended on tasters, unicorn horns, and antidotes tested on condemned prisoners. Servants licked the royal family's spoons, tried on their underpants, and tested their chamber pots.</p> <p>Ironically, royals terrified of poison were unknowingly poisoning themselves daily with their cosmetics, medications, and filthy living conditions. Women wore makeup made with mercury and lead. Men rubbed turds on their bald spots.

In this course brought to you in partnership with HISTORY®, you will be visiting some of history’s deepest rabbit-holes, across centuries and continents, in search of secret societies in all their varieties. You will journey to some very dark places, and frankly some odd and sometimes silly ones as well. During 24 eye-opening lectures, Dr. Richard B. “Rick” Spence, Professor of History at the University of Idaho, guides you through the fascinating, often mystifying - sometimes disturbing - world of brotherhoods, sisterhoods, orders, cults, and cabals that have influenced human culture from ancient times to the present.</p> <p>You’ll understand how and why secret societies have attracted some of history’s most brilliant, and some of its most evil, minds. Often demonized by their enemies, many secret societies have become the stuff of myths and conspiracy theories. Why do they exist? And when they are invented or imagined, why would someone pretend they exist? What do secret societies believe? Who do they recruit? Most important, what influence do they have?

But the truth is that the world's most successful artists did not starve. In fact they capitalized on the power of their creative strength. In <i>Real Artists Don't Starve</i>, Jeff Goins debunks the myth of the starving artist by unveiling the ideas that created it and replacing them with 14 rules for artists to thrive, including: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Steal from your influences (don't wait for inspiration) </li> <li>Collaborate with others (working alone is a surefire way to starve) </li> <li>Take strategic risks (instead of reckless ones) </li> <li>Make money in order to make more art (it's not selling out) </li> <li>Apprentice under a master (a \"lone genius\" can never reach full potential) </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Through inspiring anecdotes of successful creatives both past and present, Goins shows that living by these rules is not only doable but it's also a fulfilling way to thrive. </p> <p>From graphic designers and writers to artists and business professionals, creatives already know that no one is born an artist. Goins' revolutionary rules celebrate the process of becoming an artist, a person who utilizes the imagination in fundamental ways. He reminds creatives that business and art are not mutually exclusive pursuits. In fact success in business and in life flow from a healthy exercise of creativity. </p> <p>Expanding upon the groundbreaking work in his previous best-seller, <i>The Art of Work</i>, Goins explores the tension every creative person and organization faces in an effort to blend the inspired life with a practical path to success. Being creative isn't a disadvantage for success; rather, it is a powerful tool to be harnessed. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-06-06","publishers":[{"name":"HarperCollins Leadership"}],"categories":[{"name":"Business & Careers","url":"18572029011"},{"name":"Career Success","url":"18572070011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tnwd/000693/bk_tnwd_000693_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51sVt6I1dUL","asin":"B07JKCJ8VF","subHeading":"A Complete and Easy-to-Follow System for the Artist Who Wasn't Born with a Business Mind","title":"Art Money Success: Finally Make Money Doing What You Love","authors":"Maria Brophy","narrators":"Maria Brophy","length":"7 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51ndh7hOdnL","asin":"1977345905","subHeading":"The Essential Guide for Building Your Career as an Artist","title":"Art, Inc.","authors":"Lisa Congdon, Meg Mateo Ilasco - editor, Jonathan Field - foreword","narrators":"Lisa Congdon","length":"3 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51djBc8NqBL","asin":"1515946401","subHeading":"Everything You Need to Know (and Do) As You Pursue Your Art Career","title":"Art/Work","authors":"Heather Darcy Bhandari, Jonathan Melber","narrators":"Romy Nordlinger","length":"13 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"512nB+7eK9L","asin":"B07CX81ZLN","subHeading":"How to Develop the Right Idea, at the Right Time","title":"The Creative Curve","authors":"Allen Gannett","narrators":"Allen Gannett","length":"7 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"61T3uvjE8gL","asin":"B01NCKSP2N","title":"The Creative's Curse","authors":"Todd Brison","narrators":"Todd Brison","length":"2 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51p-G5fSe5L","asin":"B00IOTGGHK","subHeading":"Lessons from Jim Henson on Fueling Your Creative Career","title":"Make Art Make Money","authors":"Elizabeth Hyde Stevens","narrators":"Mary Robinette Kowal","length":"12 hrs and 27 mins"},{"cover":"516ophKc6bL","asin":"179720002X","subHeading":"The Essential Guide to Working Your Creative Magic","title":"Find Your Artistic Voice","authors":"Lisa Congdon","narrators":"Maggi-Meg Reed","length":"3 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"41AOPxsEEeL","asin":"B007V556PG","subHeading":"Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking","title":"Art & Fear","authors":"David Bayles, Ted Orland","narrators":"Arthur Morey","length":"3 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"51H8mUhbPAL","asin":"1649040547","subHeading":"How to Be Creative, Show Your Work, and Keep Going","title":"The Steal Like an Artist Audio Trilogy","authors":"Austin Kleon","narrators":"Austin Kleon","length":"4 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51TsRto3VYL","asin":"1797105167","subHeading":"10th Edition","title":"All You Need to Know About the Music Business","authors":"Donald S.

As a Navy SEAL, he learned how to manage the natural impulse to panic in the face of terrifying situations. As media CEO and national television commentator, he has learned how to apply those same skills in civilian life.</p> <p>Drawing on his experiences in combat and business, along with colorful anecdotes from his vast network of super-achiever friends, from astronauts to billionaires, Webb shows how people from all walks of life can stretch and transcend their boundaries and learn to use their fears as fuel to achieve more than they ever thought possible. \"Fear can be a set of manacles, holding you prisoner\", writes Webb. \"Or it can be a slingshot, catapulting you on to greatness.\"</p> <p>The key, says Webb, is not to fight fear or try to beat it back, but to embrace and harness it. In the process, rather than being your adversary, your fear becomes a secret weapon that allows you to triumph in even the most adverse situations. In <i>Mastering Fear</i>, Webb and his best-selling coauthor, John David Mann, break this transformation down into five practical steps, creating a must-listen manual for anyone looking for greater courage and mastery in their lives.</p>","releaseDate":"2018-08-07","publishers":[{"name":"Penguin Audio"}],"length":"4h 53m ","categories":[{"name":"Business & Careers","url":"18572029011"},{"name":"Management & Leadership","url":"18572049011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/peng/003986/bk_peng_003986_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51LRCzwilaL","asin":"B00JXU3V7W","subHeading":"Understanding the Keys to Personal Success","title":"The Seven Decision","authors":"Andy Andrews","narrators":"Andy Andrews","length":"6 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51K2AcjLPML","asin":"B076PSG3MV","title":"The Ultimate Jim Rohn Library","authors":"Jim Rohn","narrators":"Jim Rohn","length":"11 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"515L9m6PiDL","asin":"B071PBC4KY","subHeading":"Making Better Decisions Under Pressure","title":"Total Focus","authors":"Brandon Webb, John David Mann","narrators":"Johnathan McClain, Brandon Webb","length":"7 hrs and 38 mins"},{"cover":"41-VxqrcoPL","asin":"1984847198","subHeading":"Unexpected Ideas for Making Extra Money Without Quitting Your Day Job","title":"100 Side Hustles","authors":"Chris Guillebeau","narrators":"Chris Guillebeau","length":"7 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51jURVUWapL","asin":"B01CF4FZVC","subHeading":"The Startling Effect Other People Have on You, from the Boardroom to the Bedroom and Beyond - and What to Do About It","title":"The Power of the Other","authors":"Henry Cloud","narrators":"George Newbern","length":"5 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51xVXCYXeGL","asin":"B082VK6Q8G","subHeading":"The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers","title":"Tools of Titans","authors":"Tim Ferriss","narrators":"Ray Porter, Kaleo Griffith, Tim Ferriss, and others","length":"22 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"510IksNcG2L","asin":"B00NO6IWPC","subHeading":"How to Create the Life You Always Wanted","title":"The Power of Purpose","authors":"Les Brown","narrators":"Les Brown","length":"6 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51tpkBFzI0L","asin":"B0161R2O7W","subHeading":"Why Most People Never Learn from Their Mistakes - But Some Do","title":"Black Box Thinking","authors":"Matthew Syed","narrators":"Simon Slater","length":"12 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"417kzU+MueL","asin":"B002V59VKC","subHeading":"How to Say No and Still Get to Yes","title":"The Power of a Positive No","authors":"William Ury","narrators":"William Ury","length":"7 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51Vuhd+eLJL","asin":"B00NLPB7IK","subHeading":"The Art of Closing Sales","title":"The Psychology of Selling","authors":"Brian Tracy","narrators":"Brian Tracy","length":"5 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51VBxQn47rL","asin":"B00NOD0YI8","subHeading":"An Ex-FBI Agent's System for Speed-Reading People","title":"The Power of Body Language","authors":"Joe Navarro","narrators":"Joe Navarro","length":"6 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"61LDmMYiyYL","asin":"0525642293","subHeading":"Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future","title":"The Bullet Journal Method","authors":"Ryder Carroll","narrators":"Ryder Carroll","length":"5 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51+MXoneRBL","asin":"1721334572","subHeading":"30 Years of Lessons Learned from Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger at the Annual Shareholders Meeting","title":"University of Berkshire Hathaway","authors":"Daniel Pecaut, Corey Wrenn - contributor","narrators":"Tom Parks","length":"12 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"512nB+7eK9L","asin":"B07CX81ZLN","subHeading":"How to Develop the Right Idea, at the Right Time","title":"The Creative Curve","authors":"Allen Gannett","narrators":"Allen Gannett","length":"7 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"61LBa-MPCBL","asin":"B004S3GJYQ","subHeading":"Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long","title":"Your Brain at Work","authors":"David Rock","narrators":"Bob Walter","length":"9 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"61NmzI2c02L","asin":"B00XD08TGG","subHeading":"The 5 Forces That Will Make You Healthy, Fit, and Eternally Awesome","title":"SuperLife","authors":"Darin Olien","narrators":"Darin Olien, Matt Burns","length":"7 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"417nGJPtYML","asin":"B07J6GZSG8","subHeading":"Myth and Reality","title":"Leaders","authors":"Stanley McChrystal, Jeff Eggers, Jay Mangone","narrators":"Paul Michael, Stanley McChrystal","length":"17 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"41-RB-jQmAL","asin":"140021582X","subHeading":"Daily Habits and Practical Strategies for Sales Success","title":"A Mind for Sales","authors":"Mark Hunter CSP","narrators":"Mark Hunter CSP, Henry O.

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation?</p> <p>The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. </p> <p>In <i>The Grand Design</i> they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.</p> <p>Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.</p> <p>A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.</p>","releaseDate":"2010-09-07","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/002382/bk_rand_002382_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51AAyE4rGeL","asin":"B002V0TEUO","subHeading":"Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory","title":"The Elegant Universe","authors":"Brian Greene","narrators":"Erik Davies","length":"15 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51fa7PyEWVL","asin":"0525592474","subHeading":"Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime","title":"Something Deeply Hidden","authors":"Sean Carroll","narrators":"Sean Carroll","length":"10 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"61zewFaBaYL","asin":"B002V086LM","subHeading":"The Evidence for Evolution","title":"The Greatest Show on Earth","authors":"Richard Dawkins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins, Lalla Ward","length":"14 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51PVAIw27sL","asin":"B00NB5ED3G","subHeading":"Evolution and the Science of Creation","title":"Undeniable","authors":"Bill Nye","narrators":"Bill Nye","length":"9 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"61j+AB3GUoL","asin":"B06X9MXN32","title":"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry","authors":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","narrators":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","length":"3 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"611i5bvBAML","asin":"B002V1LFBY","subHeading":"The Origin and Fate of the Universe","title":"The Theory of Everything","authors":"Stephen Hawking","narrators":"Michael York","length":"3 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"41nlsmiWemL","asin":"B002UZL5EI","title":"The Universe in a Nutshell","authors":"Stephen Hawking","narrators":"Simon Prebble","length":"3 hrs and 27 mins"},{"cover":"41cwjBLPD9L","asin":"0525635688","subHeading":"Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems","title":"How To","authors":"Randall Munroe","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"6 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"61wt0jRsloL","asin":"0744023610","subHeading":"Big Ideas Simply Explained","title":"The Science Book","authors":"DK","narrators":"Leighton Pugh","length":"15 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"61+dSbZHK0L","asin":"B002V0K7FK","title":"A Brief History of Time","authors":"Stephen Hawking","narrators":"Michael Jackson","length":"5 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51FnCAYMjJL","asin":"1629976849","title":"Understanding Complexity","authors":"Scott E.

But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can't stay out of trouble.&nbsp;</p> <p>They've created enough colonies so humanity shouldn't go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper.&nbsp;</p> <p>Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol - unless the Others arrive first.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>All These Worlds</i> is the third installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies.</p>","releaseDate":"2017-08-08","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/029496/bk_adbl_029496_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"514MNgIFiSL","asin":"B088C4DBYP","subHeading":"Bobiverse, Book 4","title":"Heaven's River","authors":"Dennis E.

In Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, Raoul Duke (Thompson) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (inspired by a friend of Thompson) are quickly diverted to search for the American dream. Their quest is fueled by nearly every drug imaginable and quickly becomes a surreal experience that blurs the line between reality and fantasy. But there is more to this hilarious tale than reckless behavior, for underneath the hallucinogenic facade is a stinging criticism of American greed and consumerism.","releaseDate":"2005-09-26","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"length":"6h 0m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Art & Literature","url":"18571953011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/000688/bk_reco_000688_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61-boOfqbqL","asin":"B005Y2AMPC","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Rum Diary","authors":"Hunter S.

To the contrary, religion was daily life. The many dozen gods of this ancient world were everywhere, with spirits inhabiting every crack and crevice of life. These polytheists believed they had a strict contract with their deities: If they took care of their gods, their gods would take care of them (or at least not harm them). Consequently, they built extraordinary temples to honor their deities, brought food and wine to them, sacrificed animals for them, and held sacred meals with their gods. In fact, they followed numerous rules and regulations that circumscribed almost all aspects of life both inside and outside the home - anything and everything to keep the gods happy. Consequently, the religious practices of the ancient Mediterranean make a wonderful lens through which to develop a deeper understanding of their world.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2020-02-28","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Ancient History","url":"18573549011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/001174/bk_tcco_001174_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"619WeRKZrgL","asin":"B013KRSIVC","title":"Great Mythologies of the World","authors":"The Great Courses, Grant L.

In this fascinating biography, Joseph Marshall, himself a Lakota Indian, creates a vibrant portrait of the man, his times, and his legacy. <p>Drawing on firsthand research and his culture's rich oral tradition (rarely shared outside the Native American community), Marshall reveals many aspects of Crazy Horse's life, including details of the powerful vision that convinced him of his duty to help preserve the Lakota homeland, a vision that changed the course of Crazy Horse's life and spurred him confidently into battle time and time again.</p> <p> <i>The Journey of Crazy Horse</i> is the true story of how one man's fight for his people's survival roused his true genius as a strategist, commander, and trusted leader.

Now, Professor Mathewes offers you a richly provocative and revealing encounter with the question of human evil - a dynamic inquiry into Western civilization's greatest thinking and insight on this critical subject. </p> <p>With the inspired guidance of these 36 lectures, you'll engage with how both individual thinkers and larger trends of thought have faced evil, studying the work of major theologians, philosophers, poets, political theorists, novelists, psychologists, and journalists. You'll study the psychology of evil in Islamic theology, as well as the weighty meditations of St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Anselm of Lyon, and Martin Luther. And among contemporary views, you'll grasp Arthur Cohen's extraordinary post-Holocaust reformulation of faith in a God whose reality \"is our prefiguration\" - the promise of what we may become. </p> <p>Parallel with the theological accounts, you'll also study primary currents of Western secular thinking on evil in the work of key philosophers and social theorists. You'll investigate Thomas Hobbes's proposition that good and evil are invented constructs of human language, and Kant's conception of morality as located in the human will. You contemplate Freud's hypothesis of the \"death drive,\" an innate, destructive force of the psyche, and Hannah Arendt's highly influential analysis of the \"moral inversion\" of Nazism. </p> <p>So why does evil exist in the world?

Writing as an artist, activist, and social critic, Baldwin probes the complex condition of being Black in America.

His criticism on topics such as the paternalism of White progressives or on his own friend Richard Wright's work is pointed and unabashed. He was also one of the few writing on race at the time who addressed the issue with a powerful mixture of outrage at the gross physical and political violence against Black citizens and measured understanding of their oppressors, which helped awaken a White audience to the injustices under their noses. Naturally, this combination of brazen criticism and unconventional empathy for White readers won Baldwin as much condemnation as praise.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Notes</i>is the book that established Baldwin's voice as a social critic, and it remains one of his most admired works.

Without looking deeper, however, many failed to see that Farley was much more than just another Hollywood drug overdose. In this officially authorized oral history, Farley's friends and family remember his work and life. Along the way, they tell a remarkable story of boundless energy, determination, and laughter that could only keep the demons at bay for so long. </p>","releaseDate":"2013-07-31","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"18571910011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Performing Arts","url":"18571923011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/011490/bk_adbl_011490_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"516dFVm-EEL","asin":"B07B8WTK8G","title":"A Polaroid Guy in a Snapchat World","authors":"David Spade","narrators":"David Spade","length":"6 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51uXyl7NY4L","asin":"B01N5FE2B2","subHeading":"The Legendary Love Story of Television's Most Famous Couple","title":"Lucy and Desi","authors":"Warren G.

In a terrible twist of fate, Moore himself was kidnapped and subsequently held captive by Somali pirates. Subjected to conditions that break even the strongest spirits - physical injury, starvation, isolation, terror - Moore’s survival is a testament to his indomitable strength of mind. In September 2014, after 977 days, he walked free when his ransom was put together by the help of several US and German institutions, friends, colleagues, and his strong-willed mother.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet Moore’s own struggle is only part of the story: <i>The Desert and the Sea</i>&nbsp;falls at the intersection of reportage, memoir, and history. Caught between Muslim pirates, the looming threat of Al-Shabaab, and the rise of ISIS,&nbsp;Moore observes the worlds that surrounded him - the economics and history of piracy; the effects of post-colonialism; the politics of hostage negotiation and ransom; while also conjuring the various faces of Islam - and places his ordeal in the context of the larger political and historical issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A sort of <i>Catch-22</i> meets <i>Black Hawk Down, The Desert and the Sea</i>&nbsp;is written with dark humor, candor, and a journalist’s clinical distance and eye for detail.

There is no better way to study the big questions in philosophy than to compare how the world's greatest minds have analyzed these questions, defined the terms, and then reasoned out potential solutions. Once you've compared the arguments, the final step is always deciding for yourself whether you find an explanation convincing. </p> <p>This course gives you the tools to follow and create logical arguments while exploring famous philosophers' viewpoints on these important questions. Although progress has been made toward answers, brilliant thinkers have continued to wrestle with many big questions that inspire thoughtful people everywhere. These questions include: What is knowledge? Does God exist? Do humans have free will? What is right and wrong? How should society be organized? </p> <p>Given the complexity of these big questions, it should be no surprise that many controversies are far from settled. In fact, by the end of these 36 lectures, you may be even less sure of the right answers to some of the questions than you were at the beginning. But being a philosopher means constantly testing your views - giving a reasoned defense if you believe you are right and modifying your ideas when you realize you are wrong. You'll discover that great thinkers before you have offered convincing answers to hard questions, philosophers after them have made equally persuasive objections, and then still others have refined the debate even further - causing the issues to come into sharper and sharper focus. </p> <p>Join Plato, St. Anselm, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Mill, Smith, Marx, Rawls, and many others in an exploration of fundamental questions.

As you will learn, there is a recipe for success, and luck may be the least important ingredient in creating a best seller.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to solving the mystery of what makes a best-selling novel, no one has cracked the code better than James Scott Bell. A best-selling author himself, winner of the International Thriller Writers Award and the Christy Award for Suspense, plus the author of the number-one best seller for writers, <i>Plot &amp; Structure</i>, Mr. Bell has been teaching the principles of best-selling fiction for over 20 years, principles that apply to any genre or style.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the 24 lectures of <i>How to Write Best-Selling Fiction</i>, Mr. Bell provides a comprehensive, eye-opening, and illuminating survey of the entire writing process, as well as a full breakdown of how best-selling authors such as Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Michael Connelly, Suzanne Collins, Janet Evanovich, and dozens of others have implemented best practices in their own writing.&nbsp;</p> <p>From fun creative challenges to help you get started with unique plot and character ideas to how to format, package, and promote your finished material - with help dotting every \"i\" and crossing every \"t\" along the way - Mr. Bell offers an insightful, intimate, and extraordinarily revealing look at the elements that elevate a novel to become a best seller. Any aspiring author will gain a wealth of tools that will not only improve their ability to write, but will also increase their enjoyment of the craft.&nbsp;</p> <p>The famous writer Somerset Maugham once said, “There are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.” And maybe no one knows the “rules”, but there are writing techniques, practices, and fundamentals that writers have used for decades to become best-selling authors. And just like Picasso, once you master the basics of your art, then you can create your own rules. With <i>How to Write Best-Selling Fiction</i>, you get an intimate introduction to the fundamentals of how to write your best seller, from a best-selling author who has mastered the secrets to success.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2019-03-29","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"Education & Learning","url":"18573267011"},{"name":"Words, Language & Grammar","url":"18573336011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/001131/bk_tcco_001131_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"510hc6FVcHL","asin":"B07WGJ8LBT","subHeading":"The Fastest Way to Improve Any Manuscript","title":"How to Write Dazzling Dialogue","authors":"James Scott Bell","narrators":"James Scott Bell","length":"2 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"51wE7PsIWFL","asin":"B07THFLJ3H","subHeading":"A New Approach for Plotters, Pantsers and Everyone in Between","title":"Write Your Novel from the Middle","authors":"James Scott Bell","narrators":"James Scott Bell","length":"2 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"413g8AznoNL","asin":"B07HQVGZNL","subHeading":"The Last Book on Novel Writing You'll Ever Need","title":"Save the Cat!

As Cory struggles to understand his father's pain, his eyes are slowly opened to the forces of good and evil that surround him. From an ancient mystic who can hear the dead and bewitch the living, to a violent clan of moonshiners, Cory must confront the secrets that hide in the shadows of his hometown - for his father's sanity and his own life hang in the balance....</p>","releaseDate":"2014-10-07","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"20h 4m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/006862/bk_sans_006862_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"512c3fuI-hL","asin":"B079C4CMVN","title":"The Listener","authors":"Robert R.

Born in Yemen and raised in Ireland, Wales, and postwar England, he lost his mother at the age of six. In his teens he dropped out of university and took to the streets of London as part of a two-man escape act; when his partner went on vacation, Izzard kept busy by inventing a one-man act, and thus a career was ignited. As a stand-up comedian, Izzard has captivated audiences with his surreal, stream-of-consciousness comedy - lines such as \"cake or death?\" \"Death Star canteen\", and \"do you have a flag?\" have the status of great rock lyrics. As a self-proclaimed \"executive transvestite\", Izzard broke the mold performing in full makeup and heels and has become as famous for his advocacy for LGBT rights as he has for his art. In <i>Believe Me</i>, he recounts the dizzying rise he made from street busking to London's West End to Wembley Stadium and New York's Madison Square Garden. </p> <p>Still performing more than 100 shows a year - thus far in a record-breaking 28 countries worldwide - Izzard is arguably one of today's top kings of comedy. With his brand of keenly intelligent humor that ranges from world history to pop culture, politics, and philosophy, he has built an extraordinary fan base that transcends age, gender, and race. Writing with the same candor and razor-sharp insight evident in his comedy, he reflects on a childhood marked by unutterable loss, sexuality and coming out, as well as a life in show business, politics, and philanthropy. Honest and generous, Izzard's <i>Believe Me</i> is an inspired account of a very singular life thus far. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-06-13","publishers":[{"name":"Penguin Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Celebrities","url":"18571984011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/peng/003108/bk_peng_003108_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"510BktHah3L","asin":"B01M35F75P","subHeading":"An Oral History as Told by Jon Stewart, the Correspondents, Staff and Guests","title":"The Daily Show (the AudioBook)","authors":"Jon Stewart - foreword, Chris Smith","narrators":"Oliver Wyman, Jay Snyder, Kevin T.

In dispatches from a road trip to Las Vegas (part of a plan hatched to regain the fortune he'd lost to sports betting and other vices) with his sidekick and enabler, Adam Eget, Norm recounts the milestone moments, the regrets, the love affairs, the times fortune smiled on his life, and the times it refused to smile.

This is not an effort to escape life or to dwell in a place of bliss outside of this world. Instead this path will allow us to discover where we come from and where we are going. And, most of all, it will generate happiness, understanding, and love, so we can live deeply in each moment of our lives, right where we are. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-06-06","publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"18574641011"},{"name":"Philosophy","url":"18574651011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/006121/bk_harp_006121_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51pxbP9qVIL","asin":"B009ON89MA","subHeading":"Essential Wisdom for Getting Through the Storm","title":"Fear","authors":"Thich Nhat Hanh","narrators":"Dan Woren","length":"4 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"41KeIY+7WmL","asin":"B00KNBLO88","subHeading":"Transforming Suffering into Peace, Joy, and Liberation","title":"The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching","authors":"Thich Nhat Hanh","narrators":"René Ruiz","length":"9 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51TVO9ff4FL","asin":"B0036O0HUK","subHeading":"Essential Teachings on the True Source of Happiness","title":"Living Without Stress or Fear","authors":"Thich Nhat Hanh","narrators":"uncredited","length":"6 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"61CdpLBT7OL","asin":"B00PRB1Y0W","subHeading":"A Collection of Teachings on Love, Mindfulness, and Meditation","title":"Mindful Living","authors":"Thich Nhat Hanh","narrators":"Thich Nhat Hanh","length":"6 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51fPW4nQFSL","asin":"B01IQ15URC","subHeading":"Lasting Happiness in a Changing World","title":"The Book of Joy","authors":"His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Douglas Carlton Abrams","narrators":"Douglas Carlton Abrams, full cast, Francois Chau, and others","length":"10 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51lb5skZU+L","asin":"B0036HZSF6","title":"Living Buddha, Living Christ","authors":"Thich Nhat Hanh","narrators":"Ben Kingsley","length":"2 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"41iv1K9bgPL","asin":"B00AMMC6SK","subHeading":"An Introduction to the Practice of Meditation","title":"The Miracle of Mindfulness","authors":"Thich Nhat Hanh","narrators":"John Lee","length":"3 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51R9mbLFPFL","asin":"B00E65MCUG","title":"The Art of Communicating","authors":"Thich Nhat Hanh","narrators":"Dan Woren","length":"3 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51FbN5vZcfL","asin":"B01AWQEGB0","subHeading":"Walking in the Footsteps of the Buddha","title":"Old Path White Clouds","authors":"Thich Nhat Hanh","narrators":"Edoardo Ballerini","length":"16 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"51LZfA8ZIpL","asin":"B002V0TGXY","title":"The Art of Happiness","authors":"His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Howard C.

Founded by her grandfather and consisting almost entirely of her extended family, the tiny group would gain worldwide notoriety for its pickets at military funerals and celebrations of death and tragedy. As Phelps-Roper grew up, she saw that church members were close companions and accomplished debaters, applying the logic of predestination and the language of the King James Bible to everyday life with aplomb - which, as the church’s Twitter spokeswoman, she learned to do with great skill. Soon, however, dialogue on Twitter caused her to begin doubting the church’s leaders and message: If humans were sinful and fallible, how could the church itself be so confident about its beliefs? As she digitally jousted with critics, she started to wonder if sometimes they had a point - and then she began exchanging messages with a man who would help change her life.&nbsp;</p> <p>A gripping memoir of escaping extremism and falling in love, <i>Unfollow</i> relates Phelps-Roper’s moral awakening, her departure from the church, and how she exchanged the absolutes she grew up with for new forms of warmth and community.

It is, at heart, a book about creativity - but it is also, as Pixar cofounder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible”.</p> <p>For nearly 20 years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, <i>Monsters, Inc.</i>, <i>Finding Nemo</i>, <i>The Incredibles</i>, <i>Up</i>, <i>WALL-E</i>, and <i>Inside Out</i>, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner 30 Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired - and so profitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a PhD student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his cofounding Pixar in 1986. Nine years later, <i>Toy Story</i> was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success - and in the 13 movies that followed - was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.</li> <li>If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.</li> <li>It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.</li> <li>The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.</li> <li>A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.</li> </ul>","releaseDate":"2014-04-08","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Business & Careers","url":"18572029011"},{"name":"Management & Leadership","url":"18572049011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/003805/bk_rand_003805_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41e0TTYL0PL","asin":"0525499334","subHeading":"Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company","title":"The Ride of a Lifetime","authors":"Robert Iger","narrators":"Jim Frangione, Robert Iger","length":"8 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"51hTRkkURtL","asin":"B00NO2R5EK","subHeading":"A 30-Minute Instaread Summary","title":"Ed Catmull's Creativity, Inc.","authors":"Instaread Summaries","narrators":"Gonzo Shimura","length":"1 hr and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51Mfdk23bcL","asin":"B007TKVPO4","subHeading":"Mastering the Five Skills of Disruptive Innovators","title":"The Innovator's DNA","authors":"Jeff Dyer, Hal Gregersen, Clay Christensen","narrators":"Mel Foster","length":"7 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51s11AU4otL","asin":"1984891170","subHeading":"Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention","title":"No Rules Rules","authors":"Reed Hastings, Erin Meyer","narrators":"Jason Culp, Allyson Ryan","length":"9 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"513jIY6HeVL","asin":"B013F8128W","subHeading":"Mickey's Ten Commandments and the Road to Imagineering","title":"One Little Spark!","authors":"Marty Sklar","narrators":"Jeff Cummings","length":"5 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"514tHwBRBPL","asin":"B00VSEM9QK","subHeading":"How the Ability to Reset Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead","title":"Rising Strong","authors":"Brené Brown","narrators":"Brené Brown","length":"8 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51j1P236E3L","asin":"B00I0AJC2Y","subHeading":"Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers","title":"The Hard Thing About Hard Things","authors":"Ben Horowitz","narrators":"Kevin Kenerly","length":"7 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"511jhSnL8qL","asin":"B00ZSQQ67W","subHeading":"The Psychology of Discovery and Invention","title":"Creativity","authors":"Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi","narrators":"Sean Pratt","length":"15 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51eXLWYrV5L","asin":"B00R8HJRZM","subHeading":"The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader","title":"Becoming Steve Jobs","authors":"Brent Schlender, Rick Tetzeli","narrators":"George Newbern","length":"16 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51cqafqROkL","asin":"B00M9KA2ZM","subHeading":"How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution","title":"The Innovators","authors":"Walter Isaacson","narrators":"Dennis Boutsikaris","length":"17 hrs and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51S2iJN3DYL","asin":"B005V0QI82","title":"Steve Jobs","authors":"Walter Isaacson","narrators":"Dylan Baker","length":"25 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51SGjt9pPlL","asin":"B01CRM17MS","subHeading":"A Memoir by the Creator of Nike","title":"Shoe Dog","authors":"Phil Knight","narrators":"Norbert Leo Butz, Phil Knight - introduction","length":"13 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"61kFHAU5tCL","asin":"B0731N344V","subHeading":"The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made","title":"Blood, Sweat, and Pixels","authors":"Jason Schreier","narrators":"Ray Chase","length":"7 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"41UpV7crlHL","asin":"B00M27LBU2","subHeading":"Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future","title":"Zero to One","authors":"Peter Thiel, Blake Masters","narrators":"Blake Masters","length":"4 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"31Xjj1R+WuL","asin":"B002V8MDWC","subHeading":"The Making of a Company","title":"The Pixar Touch","authors":"David A.

He was fortunate to have been taught to read by his slave owner mistress, and he would go on to become one of the major literary figures of his time. He wrote three versions of his autobiography over the course of his lifetime and published his own newspaper. His very existence gave the lie to slave owners: with dignity and great intelligence, he bore witness to the brutality of slavery.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initially mentored by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass spoke widely, often to large crowds, using his own story to condemn slavery. He broke with Garrison to become a political abolitionist, a Republican, and eventually a Lincoln supporter. By the Civil War and during Reconstruction, Douglass became the most famed and widely traveled orator in the nation. He denounced the premature end of Reconstruction and the emerging Jim Crow era. In his unique and eloquent voice, written and spoken, Douglass was a fierce critic of the US as well as a radical patriot. He sometimes argued politically with younger African Americans, but he never forsook either the Republican party or the cause of Black civil and political rights.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this remarkable biography, David Blight has drawn on new information held in a private collection that few other historian have consulted, as well as recently discovered issues of Douglass’ newspapers. Blight tells the fascinating story of Douglass’ two marriages and his complex extended family. Douglass was not only an astonishing man of words, but a thinker steeped in Biblical story and theology. There has not been a major biography of Douglass in a quarter century.

It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do. </p> <p><b>Please note: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material, including endnotes, will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b> </p> <p><b>A Note from Hachette Audio</b> <br>We are deeply honored to be the audio publisher of David Foster Wallace's works, and are keenly aware of the great responsibility that attends the privilege. We felt that it was important to make <i>Infinite Jest</i> accessible in the audio format as soon as we were able, and are gratified to find that there is an audience that has been waiting for just this occasion. </p> <p>Some early listeners have been disappointed that the novel's endnotes are currently available only in text form, to be read. Choosing to include the endnotes as a downloadable PDF file, rather than as a recording by the narrator, was a difficult decision for all involved, and we debated different options at length before beginning production. The audio format allows us great opportunities to showcase Wallace's love of language and grammatical dexterity, to illuminate characters and their relationships, and to bring out some of the unique humor inherent in his work. However, there are also certain limitations to the format, and we needed let go of some of our preconceived notions about the form of <i>Infinite Jest,</i> as we must when we adapt any complex work to audio. </p> <p>The compromise we ended up with was heavily influenced by practical concerns, especially those regarding the limitations of current technology. Because some of the endnotes are pages-long digressions, if we had them read in line with the main narrative, we would have run the risk of making the already complex story unfollowable for listeners. In the end, we decided the audiobook would flow best by having the endnotes indicated by number throughout the narrative by an additional narrator. However, we acknowledge that these choices may not work for all listeners. Accordingly, our future plans are to produce the endnotes as an additional, stand-alone audio piece.</p>","releaseDate":"2012-04-09","publishers":[{"name":"Hachette Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/hach/000854/bk_hach_000854_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41E8LfMRpdL","asin":"B00C2D0B4S","title":"Infinite Jest, Part III: The Endnotes","authors":"David Foster Wallace","narrators":"Sean Pratt","length":"7 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"41Kj1W191SL","asin":"B00C4Z767Y","title":"Infinite Jest: Part II","authors":"David Foster Wallace","narrators":"Sean Pratt","length":"28 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"41eJL8JMI2L","asin":"B009XEJWP8","subHeading":"Translated by Edith Grossman","title":"Don Quixote","authors":"Miguel de Cervantes, Edith Grossman (translator)","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"39 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"41fiQBv7XSL","asin":"1799744698","title":"War and Peace (AmazonClassics Edition)","authors":"Leo Tolstoy, Louise Maude - translator, Aylmer Maude - translator","narrators":"Edoardo Ballerini","length":"55 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51k2RJ1tO2L","asin":"B008RZARVC","title":"Suttree","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Richard Poe","length":"20 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51laMWkzHjL","asin":"B07PN7DPVD","title":"H.G.

Shirer’s monumental study of Hitler’s German empire has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of the 20th century’s blackest hours. <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i> offers an unparalleled and thrillingly told examination of how Adolf Hitler nearly succeeded in conquering the world. With millions of copies in print around the globe, it has attained the status of a vital and enduring classic.</p> <p>Now, many years after the end of World War II, it may seem incredible that our most valued institutions and way of life were threatened by the menace that Hitler and the Third Reich represented. Shirer’s description of events and the cast of characters who played such pivotal roles in defining the course Europe was to take is unforgettable.</p> <p>Benefiting from his many years as a reporter, and thus a personal observer of the rise of Nazi Germany, and availing himself of some of the 485 tons of documents from the German Foreign Office, as well as countless other diaries, phone transcriptions, and other written records, meticulously kept at every level by the Germans, Shirer has put together a brutally objective account of how Hitler wrested political control of Germany, and planned and executed his six-year quest to dominate the world, only to see Germany go down in flames.</p> <p>This is a richly rewarding experience for anyone who wants to come to grips with the mysterious question of how this menace to civilization ever came into being, much less was sustained for as long as it was. The answer, unfortunately, is that most of Germany, for a whole host of reasons, embraced Nazism and the fanaticism that Hitler engendered.</p>","releaseDate":"2010-07-16","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Europe","url":"18573582011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/003870/bk_blak_003870_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51GJObuXGcL","asin":"B00L9GHGQK","subHeading":"The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire, 1936-1945","title":"The Rising Sun","authors":"John Toland","narrators":"Tom Weiner","length":"41 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51IvRQHvCsL","asin":"B00VXXUFYO","title":"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire","authors":"Edward Gibbon","narrators":"Charlton Griffin","length":"126 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"61SH0zsTWVL","asin":"B01H41BUZG","subHeading":"The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land","title":"The Crusades","authors":"Thomas Asbridge","narrators":"Derek Perkins","length":"25 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51z1aasJEVL","asin":"1982619686","subHeading":"An Inquiry into the Fall of France in 1940","title":"The Collapse of the Third Republic","authors":"William L.

This may seem hard to accept, but as Harari explains in his trademark style - thorough yet riveting - famine, plague, and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists, and criminals put together. The average American is 1,000 times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. </p> <p>What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet Earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? <i>Homo Deus</i> explores the projects, dreams, and nightmares that will shape the 21st century - from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution.

A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides - or are chosen.

But as it was first published, <i>The Stand</i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.</p> <p>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition</i> includes material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation.

Holmes combined the fair's appeal with his own fatal charms to lure scores of women to their deaths. Whereas the fair marked the birth of a new epoch in American history, Holmes marked the emergence of a new American archetype, the serial killer, who thrived on the very forces then transforming the country.</p> <p>In deft prose, Larson conveys Burnham's herculean challenge to build the White City in less than 18 months. At the same time, he describes how, in a malign parody of the achievements of the fair's builders, Holmes built his own World's Fair Hotel - a torture palace complete with a gas chamber and crematorium. Throughout the book, tension mounts on two fronts: Will Burnham complete the White City before the millions of visitors arrive at its gates?

Lured to the great Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 by the hope of becoming a samurai - without really knowing what it meant - he regains consciousness after the battle to find himself lying defeated, dazed, and wounded among thousands of the dead and dying. On his way home, he commits a rash act, becomes a fugitive, and brings life in his own village to a standstill - until he is captured by a weaponless Zen monk.</p> <p>The lovely Otsu, seeing in Musashi her ideal of manliness, frees him from his tortuous punishment, but he is recaptured and imprisoned. During three years of solitary confinement, he delves into the classics of Japan and China. When he is set free again, he rejects the position of samurai and for the next several years pursues his goal relentlessly, looking neither to the left nor to the right.</p> <p>Ever so slowly it dawns on him that following the way of the sword is not simply a matter of finding a target for his brute strength. Continually striving to perfect his technique, which leads him to a unique style of fighting with two swords simultaneously, he travels far and wide, challenging fighters of many disciplines, taking nature to be his ultimate and severest teacher and undergoing the rigorous training of those who follow the way. He is supremely successful in his encounters, but in <i>The Art of War</i>, he perceives the way of peaceful and prosperous governance and disciplines himself to be a real human being.</p> <p>He becomes a reluctant hero to a host of people whose lives he has touched and by whom he has been touched.

What’s more, the author shows that the Industrial Revolution would have been impossible without it. The science of how the drug has evolved to addict us is no less fascinating.

The fact that he is neither dead nor in a locked facility (at the time of printing) is something of a miracle in itself.

It’s also one of the only accounts; incredibly, there has never been an authoritative biography of Lee. Following a decade of research that included conducting more than 100 interviews with Lee’s family, friends, business associates, and even the actress in whose bed Lee died, Polly has constructed a complex, humane portrait of the icon.</p> <p>Polly explores Lee’s early years as a child star in Hong Kong cinema; his actor father’s struggles with opium addiction and how that turned Bruce into a troublemaking teenager who was kicked out of high school and eventually sent to America to shape up; his beginnings as a martial arts teacher, eventually becoming personal instructor to movie stars like James Coburn and Steve McQueen; his struggles as an Asian American actor in Hollywood and frustration seeing role after role he auditioned for go to a white actors in eye makeup; his eventual triumph as a leading man; his challenges juggling a sky-rocketing career with his duties as a father and husband; and his shocking end that to this day is still shrouded in mystery.</p> <p>Polly breaks down the myths surrounding Bruce Lee and argues that, contrary to popular belief, he was an ambitious actor who was obsessed with the martial arts - not a kung-fu guru who just so happened to make a couple of movies.

Thanks to rapid advances in technology and in our understanding of the brain, today’s neuroscience research goes far beyond trying to understand how the brain works, and into the search for proven ways to optimize brain performance. In <i>Your Best Brain</i>, Professor John J. Medina - an award-winning scientist, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author, and leading advocate for brain research - delivers 24 exciting lectures that probe the origins of consciousness, memory, emotion, attention, intelligence, and beyond. He focuses on five key areas of study in neuroscience: the brain’s physical structure and function, and how it enabled us to become the planet’s apex predator; the ways in which the brain processes information, and how that relates to intelligence; the intricacies of emotions and socialization, and how empathy is a vital survival mechanism; how our brains develop and change throughout our lifetimes; and how we can best use and expand our cerebral processing performance.

And not just unhealthy carbs, but even <i>healthy</i> ones like whole grains can cause dementia, ADHD, anxiety, chronic headaches, depression, and much more.

At a time when the King brand has never been stronger, he has delivered one of his most unsettling and compulsively listenable stories.&nbsp;</p> <p>An 11-year-old boy's violated corpse is found in a town park. Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City's most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the investigation expands and horrifying answers begin to emerge, King's propulsive story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense.

A generous and philanthropic man, he is preoccupied with the problems of good and evil, and with the possibility of separating them into distinct personalities. He develops a drug that transforms him into the demonic Mr. Hyde, in whose person he exhausts all the latent evil in his nature. He also creates an antidote that will restore him to his respectable existence as Dr. Jekyll. Gradually, however, the unmitigated evil of his darker self predominates until finally he performs an atrocious murder. His saner self determines to curtail these alternations of personality, but he discovers that he is losing control over his transformations and that he slips with increasing frequency into the world of evil.

And so, with help from a crew of neighborhood old-timers and the lovely Mariana - Marty's Nuyorican grief counselor - Ted orchestrates the illusion of a Sox winning streak, enabling Marty and the Red Sox to reverse the Curse of the Bambino and cruise their way to World Series victory. Well, sort of. </p> <p>David Duchovny's richly drawn <i>Bucky F*cking Dent</i> is a story of the bond between fathers and sons, Yankee fans and the Fenway faithful, and grapples with the urgent need to find our story in an age of irony and artifice. Culminating in that fateful moment in October of '78 when the meek Bucky Dent hit his way into baseball history with the unlikeliest of home runs, this tragicomic audiobook demonstrates that life truly belongs to the losers - that the long shots are the ones worth betting on. </p> <p><i>Bucky F*cking Dent</i> is a singular tale that brims with the hilarity, poignancy, and profound solitude of modern life. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-04-05","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"length":"6h 18m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/002203/bk_aren_002203_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61mpTA7neoL","asin":"B07BC9LDTV","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Miss Subways","authors":"David Duchovny","narrators":"David Duchovny, Tea Leoni","length":"6 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51hQ9NfDUeL","asin":"1250791103","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Truly Like Lightning","authors":"David Duchovny","narrators":"David Duchovny","length":"13 hrs and 53 mins"},{"cover":"51vQ8S4jqcL","asin":"B00RW6GZAE","title":"Holy Cow: A Modern-Day Dairy Tale","authors":"David Duchovny","narrators":"David Duchovny","length":"2 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"51hvCizK+AL","asin":"B01L7Q02R6","subHeading":"The EarthEnd Saga, Book 3","title":"The Sound of Seas","authors":"Gillian Anderson, Jeff Rovin","narrators":"Gillian Anderson","length":"10 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51hAR+WuhQL","asin":"B01IRUNAAG","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Christodora","authors":"Tim Murphy","narrators":"Cassandra Campbell, Christa Lewis, Suzanne Elise Freeman, and others","length":"17 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"61EzgaA89OL","asin":"B00MH3FDXC","title":"A Vision of Fire","authors":"Gillian Anderson, Jeff Rovin","narrators":"Gillian Anderson","length":"9 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"61xxBnaiwwL","asin":"B0186EXBBG","subHeading":"EarthEnd Saga #2","title":"A Dream of Ice","authors":"Gillian Anderson, Jeff Rovin","narrators":"Gillian Anderson","length":"9 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"516Da42RgNL","asin":"1721348913","subHeading":"The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons","title":"Strange Angel","authors":"George Pendle","narrators":"James Langton","length":"11 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51Puv8MKScL","asin":"B00YSPFCU6","title":"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 3/4","authors":"Sue Townsend","narrators":"Nicholas Barnes","length":"5 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51yRdXt0aLL","asin":"B072882YW6","title":"The Secret Diary of Hendrik Groen","authors":"Hendrik Groen, Hester Velmans - translator","narrators":"Derek Jacobi","length":"11 hrs and 53 mins"},{"cover":"51r+kUdxbUL","asin":"1982652004","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Correspondents","authors":"Tim Murphy","narrators":"Necar Zadegan, Assaf Cohen","length":"15 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"61IJGRDy3KL","asin":"B00NWQ9SAC","subHeading":"A Collection of New Short Humor Fiction, Odenkirk Memorial Library, Book 1","title":"A Load of Hooey","authors":"Bob Odenkirk","narrators":"Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, Jay Johnston, and others","length":"2 hrs and 27 mins"},{"cover":"51aT30KX3SL","asin":"B015NL3WZ0","subHeading":"Fiction","title":"Thirteen Ways of Looking","authors":"Colum McCann","narrators":"Colum McCann","length":"6 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"51yqbVzfGCL","asin":"1980038457","title":"The Substitution Order","authors":"Martin Clark","narrators":"David Aaron Baker","length":"13 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"61QmENo49pL","asin":"B012XF97T4","subHeading":"X-Files, Book 1","title":"Trust No One","authors":"Jonathan Maberry - editor/author","narrators":"Bronson Pinchot, Hillary Huber","length":"15 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51NBqgZBsHL","asin":"B07B3J13GQ","subHeading":"An Attempted Memoir","title":"Failure Is an Option","authors":"H.

Why do people so readily assume the worst about the motives of their fellow citizens? </p> <p>In <i>The Righteous Mind,</i> social psychologist Jonathan Haidt explores the origins of our divisions and points the way forward to mutual understanding. His starting point is moral intuition - the nearly instantaneous perceptions we all have about other people and the things they do. These intuitions feel like self-evident truths, making us righteously certain that those who see things differently are wrong. </p> <p>Haidt shows us how these intuitions differ across cultures, including the cultures of the political left and right. He blends his own research findings with those of anthropologists, historians, and other psychologists to draw a map of the moral domain, and he explains why conservatives can navigate that map more skillfully than can liberals. He then examines the origins of morality, overturning the view that evolution made us fundamentally selfish creatures. </p> <p>But rather than arguing that we are innately altruistic, he makes a more subtle claim - that we are fundamentally groupish. It is our groupishness, he explains, that leads to our greatest joys, our religious divisions, and our political affiliations. In a stunning final chapter on ideology and civility, Haidt shows what each side is right about, and why we need the insights of liberals, conservatives, and libertarians to flourish as a nation.</p>","releaseDate":"2012-07-23","publishers":[{"name":"Gildan Media, LLC"}],"categories":[{"name":"Health & Wellness","url":"18573370011"},{"name":"Psychology & Mental Health","url":"18573475011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/gdan/000759/bk_gdan_000759_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41mRYIeyrkL","asin":"B079P6VFH1","subHeading":"How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure","title":"The Coddling of the American Mind","authors":"Jonathan Haidt, Greg Lukianoff","narrators":"Jonathan Haidt","length":"10 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51Vr-xb7zbL","asin":"B07KKPNK9P","subHeading":"'Social Justice' and Its Postmodern Parentage","title":"Springtime for Snowflakes","authors":"Michael Rectenwald","narrators":"Shawn Milochik","length":"5 hrs and 20 mins"},{"cover":"41R81HfdrXL","asin":"0062954881","title":"The Case Against Socialism","authors":"Rand Paul","narrators":"Kelley Paul","length":"10 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"41dLQKEe5rL","asin":"1549199927","subHeading":"A Very Practical Guide","title":"How to Have Impossible Conversations","authors":"Peter Boghossian, James Lindsay","narrators":"Peter Boghossian","length":"6 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"61oNBcxHOhL","asin":"1472975677","subHeading":"Gender, Race and Identity","title":"The Madness of Crowds","authors":"Douglas Murray","narrators":"Douglas Murray","length":"11 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"41Z93ge9lgL","asin":"1684574986","subHeading":"Unlearning Race","title":"Self-Portrait in Black and White","authors":"Thomas Chatterton Williams","narrators":"Thomas Chatterton Williams","length":"4 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"41Lp08-lwdL","asin":"0593408519","subHeading":"12 More Rules for Life","title":"Beyond Order","authors":"Jordan B.

What if you could change it back? </p> <p>In this brilliantly conceived tour de force, Stephen King - who has absorbed the social, political, and popular culture of his generation more imaginatively and thoroughly than any other writer - takes listeners on an incredible journey into the past and the possibility of altering it. </p> <p>It begins with Jake Epping, a 35-year-old English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching GED classes. He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives, and one essay blows him away: a gruesome, harrowing story about the night more than 50 years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life - like Harry’s, like America’s in 1963 - turning on a dime. </p> <p>Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession - to prevent the Kennedy assassination. </p> <p>So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson, in a different world - of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of Derry, Maine (where there’s Dunning business to conduct), to the warmhearted small town of Jodie, Texas, where Jake falls dangerously in love, every turn is leading, eventually of course, to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas, where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful - and where history might not be history anymore. Time-travel has never been so believable.

His highly original work on elevation and awe - two long-neglected emotions - adds a new weave to that tapestry. A truly inspiring book.\" (David M. Buss, author of <i>The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating</i>)</p> <p>\"In this beautifully written book, Jonathan Haidt shows us the deep connection that exists between cutting-edge psychological research and the wisdom of the ancients. It is inspiring to see how much modern psychology informs life's most central and persistent questions\" (Barry Schwartz, author of <i>The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"In our quest for happiness, we must find a balance between modern science and ancient wisdom, between East and West, and between \"left brain\" and \"right brain\". Haidt has struck that balance perfectly, and in doing so has given us the most brilliant and lucid analysis of virtue and well-being in the entire literature of positive psychology. For the reader who seeks to understand happiness, my advice is: Begin with Haidt.\" (Martin E.P. Seligman, Director, Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania and author of <i>Authentic Happiness</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Haidt is a fine guide on this journey between past and present, discussing the current complexities of psychological theory with clarity and humor...Haidt's is an open-minded, robust look at philosophy, psychological fact and spiritual mystery, of scientific rationalism and the unknowable ephemeral - an honest inquiry that concludes that the best life is, perhaps, one lived in the balance of opposites.\" (<i>Bookpage</i>)</p>","releaseDate":"2018-05-23","publishers":[{"name":"Hachette Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Health & Wellness","url":"18573370011"},{"name":"Psychology & Mental Health","url":"18573475011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/hach/004482/bk_hach_004482_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41mRYIeyrkL","asin":"B079P6VFH1","subHeading":"How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure","title":"The Coddling of the American Mind","authors":"Jonathan Haidt, Greg Lukianoff","narrators":"Jonathan Haidt","length":"10 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51R5o-WAyjL","asin":"B07QSC29JT","subHeading":"No Guilt.

Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life - eating, drinking, and reproducing - the purpose of sleep remained elusive. </p> <p>But an explosion of scientific discoveries in the last 20 years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Among so many other things, within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity. </p> <p>Walker answers important questions about sleep: How do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us, and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and immensely accessible, <i>Why We Sleep</i> is the crucial account on sleep that will forever change listeners' minds on the subject. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-10-03","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Health & Wellness","url":"18573370011"},{"name":"Psychology & Mental Health","url":"18573475011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/008129/bk_sans_008129_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41XuXZcgBzL","asin":"0593211510","subHeading":"The New Science of a Lost Art","title":"Breath","authors":"James Nestor","narrators":"James Nestor","length":"7 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51bb7yJqDNL","asin":"1508296057","subHeading":"Why We Age - and Why We Don't Have To","title":"Lifespan","authors":"David A.

But as Charles C. Mann now makes clear, archaeologists and anthropologists have spent the last 30 years proving these and many other long-held assumptions wrong. </p> <p>In a book that startles and persuades, Mann reveals how a new generation of researchers equipped with novel scientific techniques came to previously unheard-of conclusions. Among them: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>In 1491 there were probably more people living in the Americas than in Europe. </li> <li>Certain cities - such as Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital - were far greater in population than any contemporary European city.

Nearly 50 pounds overweight at the time and unable to climb the stairs without stopping, he could see where his current sedentary lifestyle was taking him. Plunging into a new way of eating that made processed foods off-limits and prioritized plant nutrition and daily training, Rich morphed - in a matter of mere months - from out-of-shape midlifer to endurance machine.

Yes, Rich's account rivets, and yes, it instructs, providing information that will be invaluable to anyone who wants to change their physique; but this book is most notable as a powerful testament to human resiliency, for as we learn early on, Rich's childhood posed numerous physical and social challenges, and his early adulthood featured a fierce battle with alcoholism.</p> <p>Ultimately,<i> Finding Ultra</i> is a beautifully written portrait of what willpower can accomplish. It challenges all of us to rethink what we're capable of and urges us, implicitly and explicitly, to go for it.</p> <p>This revised and updated edition of <i>Finding Ultra</i> includes a new and original foreword, a bonus chapter, and updated resources.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","releaseDate":"2018-03-13","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"length":"9h 44m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Sports","url":"18572016011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/011503/bk_blak_011503_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51YR9mT6omL","asin":"B002V8KTYG","subHeading":"A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen","title":"Born to Run","authors":"Christopher McDougall","narrators":"Fred Sanders","length":"11 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51Br4TuiG6L","asin":"B07RP37JRN","title":"Broken Open: Mountains, Demons, Treadmills and a Search for Nirvana","authors":"David Clark","narrators":"David Clark","length":"11 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51BWnn20mPL","asin":"B07BLMT7Z7","title":"North","authors":"Scott Jurek, Jenny Jurek","narrators":"Scott Jurek, Jenny Jurek","length":"8 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"41tUuNQs3EL","asin":"B002VA3GIU","subHeading":"Confession of an All-Night Runner","title":"Ultramarathon Man","authors":"Dean Karnazes","narrators":"James Yaegashi","length":"6 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51A4CDim7hL","asin":"B0176MUUGS","subHeading":"31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet","title":"Living with a SEAL","authors":"Jesse Itzler","narrators":"Jesse Itzler","length":"5 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"5167Lw8C7LL","asin":"B07PXLN5VJ","title":"The PMA Effect","authors":"John Joseph","narrators":"John Joseph, Rich Roll","length":"8 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"519Qx9gCkDL","asin":"B07BFL1XWS","title":"Living with the Monks","authors":"Jesse Itzler","narrators":"Jesse Itzler","length":"7 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"51z-eGYghUL","asin":"B0082DFJ8K","subHeading":"Rejecting Middle Age, Becoming One of the World’s Fittest Men, and Discovering Myself","title":"Finding Ultra","authors":"Rich Roll","narrators":"Rich Roll","length":"9 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51DuxrripwL","asin":"1974959341","title":"The Rise of the Ultra Runners","authors":"Adharanand Finn","narrators":"Ralph Lister","length":"11 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"418439PEi-L","asin":"0593286731","subHeading":"Chasing Dreams, Befriending Pain, and Other Big Ideas","title":"Bravey","authors":"Alexi Pappas, Maya Rudolph - foreword","narrators":"Alexi Pappas, Maya Rudolph - foreword","length":"9 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51VpyGEQMEL","asin":"B07L8JXF93","subHeading":"Training for an Ultramarathon, from 50K to 100 Miles and Beyond","title":"Hal Koerner's Field Guide to Ultrarunning","authors":"Hal Koerner, Adam W.

Fascinated by the sport of freediving - in which competitors descend to great depths on a single breath - James Nestor embeds with a gang of oceangoing extreme athletes and renegade researchers. He finds whales that communicate with other whales hundreds of miles away, sharks that swim in unerringly straight lines through pitch-black waters, and other strange phenomena. Most illuminating of all, he learns that these abilities are reflected in our own remarkable and often hidden potential - including echolocation, directional sense, and the profound bodily changes humans undergo when underwater. Along the way Nestor unlocks his own freediving skills as he communes with the pioneers who are expanding our definition of what is possible in the natural world - and in ourselves. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-05-31","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"7h 36m ","categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/026296/bk_adbl_026296_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41XuXZcgBzL","asin":"0593211510","subHeading":"The New Science of a Lost Art","title":"Breath","authors":"James Nestor","narrators":"James Nestor","length":"7 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51ZBIGic7HL","asin":"1683646118","subHeading":"Activate Your Full Human Potential","title":"The Wim Hof Method","authors":"Wim Hof, Elissa Epel PhD","narrators":"Apolo Anton Ohno","length":"7 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51SxaQ6gZeL","asin":"B085CMYML2","subHeading":"Evolution, Consciousness, Stress, and the Key to Human Resilience","title":"The Wedge","authors":"Scott Carney","narrators":"Scott Carney","length":"10 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"51RcK6FWK7L","asin":"B01BLV3SRS","subHeading":"The Simple, Scientifically Proven Breathing Techniques for a Healthier, Slimmer, Faster, and Fitter You","title":"The Oxygen Advantage","authors":"Patrick McKeown","narrators":"Alan Smyth","length":"9 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"51odfeuky3L","asin":"B00B4U5OD8","subHeading":"A Story of Love, Obsession, and History's Most Insane Around-the-World Adventure","title":"Half-Safe","authors":"James Nestor","narrators":"James Nestor","length":"1 hr and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51DjnQqKp0L","asin":"B015P3K8IA","subHeading":"…And How Albert Einstein Destroyed a Planet, Discovered Relativity, and Deciphered the Universe","title":"The Hunt for Vulcan","authors":"Thomas Levenson","narrators":"Kevin Pariseau","length":"5 hrs and 49 mins"},{"cover":"51put4QV5BL","asin":"B01N5NNZF8","subHeading":"How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning Will Renew Our Lost Evolutionary Strength","title":"What Doesn't Kill Us","authors":"Scott Carney","narrators":"Scott Carney","length":"9 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"418VSCNPlJL","asin":"B01G2BJ9AM","subHeading":"Freediving, Death, and the Quest to Shatter Human Limits","title":"One Breath","authors":"Adam Skolnick","narrators":"Paul Boehmer","length":"12 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"616Z9aXJ7oL","asin":"B01GOLTYSC","subHeading":"How Tiny Creatures Manipulate Our Behavior and Shape Society","title":"This Is Your Brain on Parasites","authors":"Kathleen McAuliffe","narrators":"Nicol Zanzarella","length":"8 hrs and 20 mins"},{"cover":"615wPw7acCL","asin":"B00CX727KE","subHeading":"How Albert Einstein's Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time: Great Discoveries","title":"Einstein's Cosmos","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Ray Porter","length":"6 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51tgf6NRu+L","asin":"1683644123","subHeading":"Wim Hof on His Method and His Mission","title":"The Iceman Speaks","authors":"Wim Hof","narrators":"Wim Hof","length":"10 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51zdxGP3JUL","asin":"B07KJT11JZ","subHeading":"How the Wim Hof Method Creates Radiant, Longterm Health","title":"The Way of the Iceman","authors":"Wim Hof, Koen De Jong","narrators":"Patric LeVang","length":"2 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51tHkSN+mJL","asin":"B008DF9KY6","subHeading":"The First 4.5 Billion Years, from Stardust to Living Planet","title":"The Story of Earth","authors":"Robert M.

A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out. </p> <p>We all have a voice in our head. It's what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we're not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we're stuck with this voice that there's nothing we can do to rein it in but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It's a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it's something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness. </p> <p><i>10% Happier</i> takes listeners on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America's spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.
